            <p class="text-gray-500 text-sm mb-10">Reading time: 7 minutes &nbsp;|&nbsp; Topic: Candidate Screening</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Shortlisting is the most important step in the hiring process, and the one most often done badly. Get it right and you move to interviews with a group of genuinely qualified candidates. Get it wrong and you either waste time interviewing people who were never going to succeed, or — worse — you miss the right hire entirely.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">This guide gives you a systematic approach to shortlisting that's both faster and more reliable than reading your way through a pile of CVs.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">What Shortlisting Really Means</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Shortlisting is the process of filtering all applications down to a manageable number of candidates who will proceed to interviews. The shortlist is your pool of viable options — every person on it should be someone who could plausibly get the job.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">A common rule of thumb: shortlist 5–8 candidates per role for a first interview round. Fewer than five and you risk not having good options if some decline or perform poorly. More than eight and you're investing interview time that compounds quickly.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Shortlisting is the bridge between initial screening — covered in our guide on <a href="/how-to-screen-resumes-faster.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">how to screen resumes faster</a> — and the interview stage.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Before You Start: Define Your Criteria</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">The most critical step in shortlisting happens before you read a single CV: defining your criteria. Criteria defined after you've started reading applications are unconsciously shaped by what you've already seen. Criteria defined beforehand reflect what the role actually needs.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Separate your criteria into two categories:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li><strong>Essential requirements</strong> — minimum qualifications without which the candidate cannot do the job. Any candidate who fails an essential criterion is out immediately.</li>
                <li><strong>Desirable qualities</strong> — attributes that would make a candidate stronger but aren't dealbreakers. These are your tiebreakers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Write these down before you start. Share them with anyone else involved in the process. This ensures consistency across all reviewers.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">The Scoring Method That Works</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Once your criteria are defined, apply a simple numerical scoring system to each candidate. A 1–5 scale works well:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li><strong>1</strong> — Does not meet the criterion at all</li>
                <li><strong>2</strong> — Partially meets it (below expectations)</li>
                <li><strong>3</strong> — Meets the criterion adequately</li>
                <li><strong>4</strong> — Meets it well, above the minimum</li>
                <li><strong>5</strong> — Exceeds it; significantly strong in this area</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Weight criteria by their importance to the role. A skill that's central to daily work should carry more weight than a nice-to-have background. Calculate a weighted total for each candidate and shortlist the highest scorers.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">When candidate data is structured — as it is after <a href="/resume-data-extraction.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">how resume data extraction works</a> — this scoring can be done directly in a spreadsheet rather than in your head while reading PDFs.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Common Shortlisting Mistakes</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li><strong>Favouring familiar company names</strong> — a candidate from an impressive-sounding company isn't automatically more capable. Score for experience, not brand recognition.</li>
                <li><strong>Shortlisting too many</strong> — if you take twenty candidates to interview you'll spend weeks in interviews and still struggle to decide. Be ruthless at the shortlist stage.</li>
                <li><strong>Formatting bias</strong> — a beautifully designed CV doesn't indicate better job performance. Structured data from parsed CVs removes formatting as a variable entirely.</li>
                <li><strong>Making decisions without written criteria</strong> — "gut feel" shortlisting is legally risky and statistically worse than structured scoring.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">How to Handle High-Volume Applications</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">When you receive fifty or more applications, manual shortlisting becomes genuinely unmanageable. The solution is a two-stage approach:</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg"><strong>Stage 1 — Automated first pass:</strong> Use a semantic CV parser to extract data from all CVs simultaneously and rank them by match to your job description. This gives you a pre-scored list where the most relevant candidates rise to the top automatically.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg"><strong>Stage 2 — Manual review of the top tier:</strong> Review the top fifteen to twenty from the parsed, ranked list. Apply your scoring rubric. Shortlist the five to eight highest scorers.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">With <a href="/cv-parser-csv-export.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">exporting candidate data to CSV for shortlisting</a>, this entire process can happen in a spreadsheet — one row per candidate, columns for each criterion, formulas for weighted scores.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">The Legal Side of Shortlisting</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Shortlisting decisions are potentially subject to discrimination law. Documenting your criteria and how you applied them protects your business if a rejected candidate later challenges the decision. This is another reason why written, consistent criteria are not just a best practice — they're a form of legal protection.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Keep your scoring notes for at least six months after a hiring round closes.</p>
