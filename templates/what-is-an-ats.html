            <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">What Is an ATS? A Plain-English Guide for Small Business Owners</h1>
            <p class="text-gray-500 text-sm mb-10">Reading time: 6 minutes &nbsp;|&nbsp; Topic: Recruitment Technology</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">You've probably heard the acronym. "We use an ATS." "Make sure your CV is ATS-friendly." "Apply through our ATS portal." But what does it actually mean — and more importantly, does your small business need one?</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">This guide cuts through the jargon and gives you a clear picture of what an ATS does, where it came from, and whether it's the right tool for a team your size.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">ATS in Plain English</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">ATS stands for Applicant Tracking System. At its core, it's a database for managing job applications. When a candidate applies for a role, the ATS stores their CV, tracks where they are in the process (applied, phone screen, interview, offer, hired), and lets the hiring team add notes and make decisions — all in one place.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Most modern ATS platforms also include a CV parsing component — software that reads submitted resumes and extracts structured data from them. To understand <a href="/what-is-a-cv-parser.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">what a CV parser does</a> in detail, it helps to know that the parsing step is just one piece of what a full ATS handles.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">What an ATS Actually Does</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">A full-featured ATS typically handles:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li><strong>Job posting management</strong> — publish roles to job boards from one dashboard</li>
                <li><strong>Application collection</strong> — a branded careers page that funnels applications into one inbox</li>
                <li><strong>Resume parsing</strong> — extract and store candidate data in structured fields</li>
                <li><strong>Candidate pipeline tracking</strong> — move candidates through stages with visual kanban boards</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration tools</strong> — share candidate profiles, leave notes, and score together</li>
                <li><strong>Communication templates</strong> — automated acknowledgement and rejection emails</li>
                <li><strong>Reporting</strong> — time-to-hire, source of candidates, conversion rates</li>
                <li><strong>Compliance and documentation</strong> — audit trails for legal and regulatory requirements</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">The History of ATS: Built for Big Companies</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Applicant tracking systems emerged in the 1990s and early 2000s, built for one specific customer: large enterprises processing thousands of applications per month. Think retail chains, financial institutions, tech companies with global hiring programmes.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">The design reflects that origin. These systems are complex, feature-heavy, and built around the assumption that you have an HR team to configure and maintain them. A typical enterprise ATS implementation takes weeks of setup and requires training for everyone who uses it.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">The price reflects it too. Enterprise ATS platforms commonly cost £300–£2,000 per month or more, often billed annually with a minimum seat count. For a business hiring two or three people per year, that's a poor return on investment.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">The ATS Problem for Small Businesses</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Small businesses that try to use enterprise ATS tools run into the same problems repeatedly:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li><strong>Too many features</strong> — compliance workflows, HRIS integrations, EEO tracking — that you'll never use</li>
                <li><strong>Too much setup</strong> — configuring pipelines, stages, and email templates before you can even post a job</li>
                <li><strong>Keyword-only screening</strong> — most ATS use basic keyword matching that rejects qualified candidates who phrase things differently</li>
                <li><strong>Annual contracts</strong> — you're locked into 12 months of cost even if you only hire once</li>
                <li><strong>Candidate experience damage</strong> — clunky application portals lose candidates before you even see their CVs</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">The mismatch between what enterprise ATS provides and what small businesses actually need is significant. If you want a broader comparison, see our guide on <a href="/ats-vs-manual-screening.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">ATS versus manual screening</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">What Small Businesses Actually Need Instead</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">For most small businesses — those hiring fewer than 20 people per year — the full ATS is overkill. What you actually need is much simpler:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li>A way to <strong>collect CVs in one place</strong> (an email folder works fine)</li>
                <li>A way to <strong>screen CVs efficiently</strong> without reading every word (this is where a CV parser shines)</li>
                <li>A way to <strong>track candidate stages</strong> (a Google Sheet is sufficient for most teams)</li>
                <li>A way to <strong>collaborate with colleagues</strong> on shortlisting (shared spreadsheet or document)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">A lightweight semantic CV parser covers the hardest part of this — the screening — while leaving the rest to tools you already use.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">When Does a Small Business Actually Need an ATS?</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">There are scenarios where a proper ATS becomes justified even for a smaller organisation:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li>You're hiring more than <strong>10–15 people per month</strong> consistently</li>
                <li>You have <strong>multiple open roles simultaneously</strong> that different team members manage</li>
                <li>You face <strong>compliance requirements</strong> — government contracting, regulated industries — that require documented audit trails</li>
                <li>You have a <strong>dedicated HR person</strong> who will own the system</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">If none of those apply, you're likely better served by a lightweight approach.
