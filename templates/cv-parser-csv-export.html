            <p class="text-gray-500 text-sm mb-10">Reading time: 7 minutes &nbsp;|&nbsp; Topic: CV Parser Features</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Most CV parsers extract data and display it in their own interface. The ones that also export to CSV give you something fundamentally more useful: a portable, shareable, filterable database of candidates that works in any tool and doesn't disappear when you close the browser.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">For small businesses that run lean hiring processes — no dedicated HR system, no ATS, a spreadsheet and good judgment — CSV export is what makes a CV parser actually useful rather than just technically impressive.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">The Problem With PDFs as a Hiring Database</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">The typical small business hiring setup: a folder on the desktop, or an email inbox, containing thirty to fifty PDF CVs. The information is all there — but you can't do anything with it.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li>You can't sort candidates by years of experience without reading them all</li>
                <li>You can't filter by skill without scanning every document</li>
                <li>You can't share a "candidate database" with a co-founder — you share PDFs</li>
                <li>You can't compare candidates side-by-side without toggling between documents</li>
                <li>You can't search for a specific candidate by name without file browsing</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">A PDF folder is an archive, not a database. The moment you parse those CVs and export to CSV, you have something you can actually work with. To understand what gets captured in that process, our guide on <a href="/resume-data-extraction.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">how resume data extraction works</a> covers the technical detail.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">What CSV Export Actually Gives You</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">A CSV with candidate data is a spreadsheet where every row is a candidate and every column is a field extracted from their CV. In practice, this means:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li><strong>Instant filtering</strong> — filter to see only candidates with 3+ years of experience, or only candidates with a specific skill</li>
                <li><strong>Sorting by match score</strong> — if the parser includes a semantic relevance score, sort by it and your best candidates rise to the top</li>
                <li><strong>Team collaboration</strong> — share one file instead of thirty PDFs; team members add their own notes or scores in new columns</li>
                <li><strong>Import into any system</strong> — CRM, lightweight ATS, project tracker — any tool that accepts CSV can receive your candidate data</li>
                <li><strong>Record keeping</strong> — documented evidence of who applied and what decisions were made, useful if a hiring decision is ever challenged</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">What Fields Should Be in the CSV Export?</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">A well-structured CSV export should include at minimum:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li><strong>Name</strong> — full name of the candidate</li>
                <li><strong>Email</strong> — primary contact email</li>
                <li><strong>Phone</strong> — contact number if provided</li>
                <li><strong>Current/most recent job title</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Years of experience</strong> — calculated from work history dates</li>
                <li><strong>Top skills</strong> — comma-separated list from the skills section</li>
                <li><strong>Education</strong> — highest qualification and institution</li>
                <li><strong>Semantic match score</strong> — the candidate's relevance to your job description, expressed as a percentage</li>
                <li><strong>Summary</strong> — the candidate's own professional summary if present</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">The semantic match score is the most valuable field for shortlisting. Sort the entire CSV by match score descending and your most relevant candidates appear at the top — no manual reading required for the first pass.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">How to Use Exported Candidate Data</h2>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">In Google Sheets for Shortlisting</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Import the CSV, add columns for "Shortlisted?" and "Notes." Sort by match score. Apply a filter for minimum years of experience. Review the top-scoring candidates with a proper read. Highlight shortlisted candidates in green. Your shortlist is ready in under an hour for thirty applications.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">For Team Collaboration</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Share the Google Sheet with anyone involved in the decision. Each reviewer adds a column with their own score (1–5) for each candidate they review. Average the scores. Make the shortlist decision as a team, asynchronously, without a meeting. For a full methodology, see our guide on <a href="/how-to-shortlist-candidates.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">how to shortlist candidates using your CSV data</a>.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Building a Talent Pool</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Strong candidates who don't get the role this time are often worth keeping. Export your CSV after each hiring round and store it in a talent pool folder. When a similar role opens in six months, search your stored data before posting a new job. You may already have your hire.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">What Makes a Good CSV Export</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li><strong>Clean, consistent formatting</strong> — dates in the same format, skills in a predictable structure</li>
                <li><strong>All fields populated where data exists</strong> — too many empty cells suggest poor extraction accuracy</li>
                <li><strong>Match score included</strong> — not just extracted data but ranked data</li>
                <li><strong>One-click export</strong> — if downloading requires navigating through multiple menus, it creates friction that discourages use</li>
                <li><strong>No proprietary formats</strong> — standard CSV that opens in Excel and Google Sheets without any import steps</li>
            </ul>
