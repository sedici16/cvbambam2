            <p class="text-gray-500 text-sm mb-10">Reading time: 8 minutes &nbsp;|&nbsp; Topic: Hiring Process Design</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">A hiring pipeline is simply a structured sequence of steps that every candidate moves through from application to decision. Without one, hiring becomes reactive and inconsistent — different candidates experience different processes, decisions are made under pressure, and good candidates fall through the gaps.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">The good news for small businesses: a good hiring pipeline doesn't need to be complex. This guide gives you a five-stage framework you can implement immediately, with no specialist software required.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">What Is a Hiring Pipeline?</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">A hiring pipeline defines the stages every candidate passes through when you're recruiting for a role. Think of it as a funnel: many candidates enter at the top, and a small number exit at the bottom with an offer. At each stage, you make a deliberate decision about who proceeds and who doesn't.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">A pipeline forces consistency — every candidate for the same role goes through the same stages. It also makes the process measurable: you can track how many candidates you're losing at each stage and why. For a practical guide to the full hiring process, see our article on <a href="/how-to-hire-for-small-business.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">the full small business hiring guide</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">The 5 Core Stages of a Small Business Hiring Pipeline</h2>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Stage 1 — Job Posting and Attraction</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">The pipeline begins before you receive a single application. A well-written job description, posted on the right channel, determines the quality of your applicant pool. Invest time here: a clear, outcome-focused posting attracts better candidates and reduces the number of obviously wrong applications you have to screen.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Choose one or two channels based on the role type. Set a clear application deadline — open-ended postings create ambiguity and extend your timeline unnecessarily.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Stage 2 — Application Collection</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">All applications should arrive through a single channel — one email address, one form, one platform. Multiple intake points mean applications get scattered and some get missed. Keep it simple: a dedicated email address for applications is often enough for small businesses hiring infrequently.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Send an automated acknowledgement to every applicant immediately. It's a basic courtesy that also signals your organisation is professional.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Stage 3 — Resume Screening</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">This is the highest-leverage stage for automation. A semantic CV parser reads all submitted CVs simultaneously, extracts structured data from each, and ranks candidates by relevance to your job description. Your role at this stage becomes reviewing the pre-ranked output rather than reading raw PDFs.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Target outcome: a shortlist of 6–10 qualified candidates. For a detailed breakdown of the screening step, see our guide on <a href="/how-to-shortlist-candidates.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">how to shortlist candidates at the screening stage</a>.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">The screening stage is also where most small businesses lose time. For a comparison of approaches, see our article on <a href="/ats-vs-manual-screening.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">comparing ATS to manual screening for your pipeline</a>.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Stage 4 — Interviews</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">For most small business roles, two interview rounds is optimal: a 15–20 minute phone screen to verify basics and assess communication, followed by one structured in-person or video interview of 45–60 minutes. More rounds and strong candidates drop out; fewer rounds and you lack sufficient information to decide confidently.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Use the same structured questions for every candidate in the same role. Score each interview immediately after it ends — memory fades fast and bias increases over time.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Stage 5 — Decision and Offer</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Review interview scores, make a decision within 48 hours of your final interview, and extend the verbal offer the same day. Good candidates have competing options and will take other roles while you deliberate. Speed at this stage is a competitive advantage.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">If you're genuinely undecided between two candidates, go back to your scoring rubric rather than extending the process further. The data you've already collected should resolve it.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Setting Up Your Pipeline Without Expensive Software</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">You don't need to pay for an ATS to run a consistent hiring pipeline. A lightweight stack works well for most small businesses:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li><strong>CV parser</strong> — handles Stage 3 automatically; explore <a href="/lightweight-ats-alternatives.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">lightweight ATS alternatives</a> for the options</li>
                <li><strong>Google Sheets</strong> — track each candidate's stage, scores, and notes</li>
                <li><strong>Calendly</strong> — let candidates book their own interview slots</li>
                <li><strong>CSV export from your parser</strong> — feeds structured data directly into your tracking sheet</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Total setup time: under thirty minutes. Total monthly cost: free.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Key Metrics to Track in Your Pipeline</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li><strong>Time to hire</strong> — from job posting to accepted offer. Most small businesses can achieve 3–4 weeks.</li>
                <li><strong>Stage conversion rate</strong> — what % of applicants make it to screening, screening to interview, interview to offer?</li>
                <li><strong>Cost per hire</strong> — job board fees plus your time. Track this to understand the true investment.</li>
                <li><strong>Offer acceptance rate</strong> — if candidates are regularly declining, review your offer or process speed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Common Pipeline Mistakes Small Teams Make</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li><strong>Too many interview rounds</strong> — each additional round loses a percentage of your candidate pool</li>
                <li><strong>Inconsistent criteria</strong> — if two team members review CVs with different standards, your shortlist is random</li>
                <li><strong>No candidate communication</strong> — leaving rejected candidates in limbo damages your employer brand</li>
                <li><strong>Starting interviews before screening is complete</strong> — you might interview weak candidates while strong ones are still in the pile</li>
            </ul>
