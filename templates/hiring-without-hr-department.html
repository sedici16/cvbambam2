            <p class="text-gray-500 text-sm mb-10">Reading time: 7 minutes &nbsp;|&nbsp; Topic: Small Business Hiring</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Most small businesses don't have an HR department. They have a founder, an office manager, or a team lead who handles hiring on top of everything else. If that's you, this guide is written for your reality — not the idealised world of dedicated talent acquisition teams and six-stage interview pipelines.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Hiring without HR support is completely manageable with the right lightweight process. Here's what actually works.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">The Reality of Small Business Hiring</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Most businesses don't hire a dedicated HR person until they have 15–20 employees or more. Until that threshold, hiring is handled by whoever has capacity — which usually means whoever has the least capacity, because they're the most needed.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">The stakes are high. Research consistently puts the cost of a bad hire at 1.5–2x that person's annual salary when you account for lost productivity, management time, and the cost of replacing them. In a team of five, one wrong hire doesn't just affect one role — it affects everyone.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">And yet most small business owners approach hiring reactively: a role opens, an ad goes up, CVs arrive, and decisions get made under pressure without a consistent process.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">The Three Biggest Challenges Without HR</h2>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">1. Time</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">A full hiring process — writing a job description, posting it, screening CVs, conducting interviews, checking references, making an offer — easily takes 20 to 40 hours of work per hire. For a business owner already working full-time on their business, that's a significant disruption.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">2. Consistency</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Without a structured process, decisions become inconsistent. Different candidates get asked different questions. Screening criteria shift between the first CV you read and the thirtieth. Gut feeling dominates what should be a logical evaluation. These inconsistencies produce worse outcomes and create legal exposure.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">3. Compliance</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Employment law is complex and changes regularly. Unfair dismissal, discrimination in hiring, right-to-work checks — these all apply to small businesses the same as large ones, with the same legal consequences. Without an HR function to stay on top of this, it's easy to inadvertently create liability.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">What Actually Works — Building a Lightweight Process</h2>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Write a clear job description once, then reuse and update it</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">A well-written job description is reusable across future hiring rounds for similar roles. Invest time the first time — use it again. Focus on outcomes, not just activities. Candidates who understand what success looks like self-select more accurately.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Set a simple scoring rubric before applications open</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Define 3–5 criteria and how you'll score them (1–5 scale, or simple yes/no for must-haves) before you see a single application. This prevents anchoring bias — where the first CV you read unconsciously sets the standard for all others.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Use one channel, not ten</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">More job boards means more applications to manage, not necessarily better candidates. Choose one primary channel based on the role type and commit to it for the first week. Expand only if volume is genuinely insufficient.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Time-box your reviewing</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Allocate a fixed time slot each day for CV review — one hour maximum. Decision quality drops significantly after sustained review. Doing it in short, focused sessions produces better outcomes than an eight-hour marathon.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Tools That Replace What HR Would Do</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">HR departments use specialist tools because the volume justifies it. Small businesses can replicate most of what they do with a lightweight stack:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li><strong>CV parsing tool</strong> — handles the screening step; see our guide to <a href="/lightweight-ats-alternatives.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">lightweight alternatives to enterprise ATS</a></li>
                <li><strong>Google Sheets or Notion</strong> — candidate tracking by stage</li>
                <li><strong>Calendly</strong> — interview scheduling without email chains</li>
                <li><strong>Reference check template</strong> — a consistent set of questions for every reference</li>
                <li><strong>CSV export from your parser</strong> — structured candidate data you can share instantly</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">When Should You Actually Hire an HR Person?</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">There's a threshold where managing hiring yourself stops making sense. Common signals:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li>You have 15+ employees and are hiring regularly</li>
                <li>You're operating in a regulated industry with complex compliance requirements</li>
                <li>You're managing performance issues, disciplinaries, or disputes — which is HR work too</li>
                <li>Hiring is consistently taking you away from your core business function</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Until that point, a lightweight process and the right tools is the more efficient approach.
