            <p class="text-gray-500 text-sm mb-10">Reading time: 7 minutes &nbsp;|&nbsp; Topic: Small Business Hiring</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Hiring is one of the highest-leverage decisions a small business owner makes. Get it right and you multiply your capacity. Get it wrong and you spend months fixing the fallout. Yet most small businesses approach hiring with no process at all — just an ad on a job board, a stack of emailed CVs, and a gut feeling.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">This guide gives you a practical, step-by-step framework for hiring well — even without an HR team, dedicated recruiter, or enterprise software budget.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Why Hiring Is Different for Small Businesses</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">In a large company, a bad hire is a manageable problem. In a five-person team, it's a crisis. Every new person changes the culture, the dynamics, and the direction of the business. The stakes are asymmetrically high.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Small businesses also face a different practical reality: the owner or a manager handles hiring on top of everything else. There's no HR department to absorb the workload, no talent acquisition team to write job descriptions, no ATS pre-configured and waiting. You have to build a process from scratch — and make it simple enough that you'll actually follow it.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">The good news: a structured approach doesn't require complexity. The five steps below will carry you from "I need to hire someone" to "offer accepted" — consistently and efficiently.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Step 1 — Define What You Actually Need</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Before writing a single word of a job posting, answer three questions:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li><strong>What outcomes do I need from this person in their first 90 days?</strong></li>
                <li><strong>What skills are non-negotiable versus nice-to-have?</strong></li>
                <li><strong>What kind of working style fits our team?</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Most small business job descriptions describe activities ("answer customer enquiries, manage social media accounts") rather than outcomes ("own our customer satisfaction score, grow our Instagram following by 30% in six months"). Outcomes-focused descriptions attract better candidates and set clear expectations from day one.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Separate your list into must-haves and desirables. Must-haves are your screening criteria — anyone who doesn't meet them goes no further. Desirables are tiebreakers. This distinction will save you hours during CV review.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Step 2 — Decide Where to Post</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">More channels does not mean better candidates. It means more volume to manage. For most small businesses, one or two channels is enough:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li><strong>LinkedIn</strong> — best for professional/office roles and roles requiring specific credentials</li>
                <li><strong>Indeed</strong> — broadest reach for operational, retail, and trade roles</li>
                <li><strong>Industry-specific job boards</strong> — better signal-to-noise ratio for specialist roles</li>
                <li><strong>Employee referrals</strong> — highest quality hires, lowest cost; ask your team first</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Post on one channel, wait a week, then decide whether to expand. Starting wide creates a screening burden that derails the whole process.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Step 3 — Screen CVs Without Losing Your Mind</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">CV screening is where most small business hiring processes fall apart. Fifty CVs arrive. You read the first ten carefully, skim the next twenty, glance at the rest, and make a pile that feels overwhelming.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">The fix: use your must-have criteria as a binary filter. Does this candidate meet criterion A? Criterion B? Criterion C? Anyone who fails any must-have goes in the no pile immediately. You're not judging overall quality at this stage — you're enforcing minimum standards.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Technology can do this first pass for you. When <a href="/ats-vs-manual-screening.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">comparing ATS to manual resume screening</a>, the time savings at this stage alone justify using a tool. A semantic CV parser reads all your CVs in seconds, extracts key data, and ranks candidates by fit — so your first-pass shortlist is waiting for you when you sit down to review.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Aim to take 20–30 candidates to a shortlist of 6–10 for further review. From there, you're ready for interviews.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Step 4 — Interview Strategically</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">For most small business roles, two rounds is the right number: a short phone screen (15–20 minutes) to check basics, followed by one structured in-person or video interview. More than two rounds and good candidates drop out of your process.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Use the same questions for every candidate in the same role. This makes comparisons fair and meaningful. Ask behavioural questions — "Tell me about a time when..." — rather than hypotheticals. What people have done is a much better predictor of what they'll do than what they say they would do in a theoretical scenario.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Score each interview on the same rubric you defined in Step 1. Written scores, not memory.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Step 5 — Make the Decision and Move Fast</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">The best candidates have options. If your process takes six weeks from application to offer, you'll lose them. Once your interview scores are in, make a decision within 48 hours and extend the offer verbally the same day.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">If you're unsure between two candidates, revisit your scoring rubric rather than extending the process. Prolonged indecision doesn't produce better hires — it just loses both candidates.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">For guidance on structuring the full pipeline that connects these steps, see our article on <a href="/build-hiring-pipeline.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">building a hiring pipeline</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Tools That Make Small Business Hiring Easier</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">You don't need enterprise software. You need tools that match your scale:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li><strong>CV parser</strong> — automates the screening step; see the <a href="/best-cv-parsers-small-business.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">best CV parsing tools for small teams</a></li>
                <li><strong>Google Sheets</strong> — track candidates through stages with a simple kanban or table</li>
                <li><strong>Calendly</strong> — eliminate the back-and-forth of interview scheduling</li>
                <li><strong>A structured scorecard</strong> — one shared document where interviewers score candidates</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">If you're unsure whether you even need software, read our explainer on <a href="/what-is-an-ats.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">what an ATS is and whether you need one</a>.</p>
