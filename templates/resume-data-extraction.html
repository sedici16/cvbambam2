            <p class="text-gray-500 text-sm mb-10">Reading time: 6 minutes &nbsp;|&nbsp; Topic: CV Parsing Technology</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">A PDF resume is an unstructured document. The information is all there — name, experience, skills, education — but it's embedded in formatting, bullet points, and layout that a computer can't naturally sort, filter, or compare. Resume data extraction is the process of pulling that information out and turning it into structured, usable data.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">For small businesses managing hiring without dedicated HR support, it's the technology that turns a folder full of PDFs into an actionable candidate spreadsheet.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">What Is Resume Data Extraction?</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Resume data extraction is the automated process of reading an unstructured resume document and producing structured output — organised fields containing specific pieces of information. Input: a PDF or Word file. Output: a database record with name, email, phone, work history, skills, education, and more.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">This is the core function of a CV parser. To understand the broader context of <a href="/what-is-a-cv-parser.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">what a CV parser is and how it works</a>, it helps to know that data extraction is the foundational step everything else is built on.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">What Data Gets Extracted?</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">A well-built extraction system captures the following fields from each resume:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li><strong>Contact information</strong> — full name, email address, phone number, LinkedIn URL</li>
                <li><strong>Work history</strong> — company names, job titles, employment dates, and in some cases key responsibilities extracted from bullet points</li>
                <li><strong>Education</strong> — institution names, degree types, fields of study, graduation years</li>
                <li><strong>Skills</strong> — technical skills, software, languages, certifications, and soft skills mentioned explicitly</li>
                <li><strong>Professional summary</strong> — the candidate's own summary or objective statement, if present</li>
                <li><strong>Languages</strong> — languages spoken and proficiency levels if stated</li>
                <li><strong>Location</strong> — current city or region if mentioned</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Advanced systems also calculate derived fields: total years of experience, career progression trajectory, and most critically — a semantic match score that indicates how well the candidate's overall profile aligns with a specific job description.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">How AI Extracts Data From Resumes</h2>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Document Parsing</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">The first step is extracting raw text from the document format. PDFs can store text in several different ways — embedded text, image-based, or mixed — requiring different technical approaches for each. Word documents (DOCX) are more straightforward but still require parsing. Modern systems handle all common formats reliably.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Named Entity Recognition (NER)</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">NER models identify and classify named entities in text: person names, organisations, dates, locations, email addresses. In a resume context, this means recognising "Google" as an employer, "July 2019 – March 2022" as a date range, and "jane.smith@email.com" as a contact detail. NER is the backbone of accurate field extraction.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Section Detection</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Resumes are divided into logical sections — Experience, Education, Skills, Certifications — but these sections are labelled inconsistently across different CV formats and cultures. Section detection identifies the boundaries of each block of content and classifies it, so experience entries are distinguished from education entries even when formatted very differently.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Normalisation</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Raw extracted data needs to be standardised for comparison. Date formats ("Jan 2020," "01/2020," "January 2020" all mean the same thing), job title variants, and skill synonyms all require normalisation to make candidate data consistently comparable across a batch of applications.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Why Accuracy Matters So Much</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Poor extraction accuracy doesn't just produce imprecise data — it produces actively misleading data. An incorrectly extracted email address means you can't contact the candidate. A wrong date range inflates or deflates years of experience. Missed skills mean candidates score lower than they should on matching.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">The accuracy gap between rule-based (legacy) parsers and modern AI-based extractors is significant. Rule-based parsers work well on CVs that match expected formats but fail unpredictably on unusual layouts. AI-based systems generalise much better across the enormous variety of real-world resume formats.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">What You Can Do With Extracted Resume Data</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Extracted, structured data opens up a range of capabilities that are simply impossible with raw PDF files:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li><strong>Score and rank candidates</strong> against your job description using semantic matching</li>
                <li><strong>Filter instantly</strong> — find candidates with specific skills or minimum experience in one step</li>
                <li><strong>Compare side-by-side</strong> — all candidates in one spreadsheet, all fields aligned</li>
                <li><strong>Share with your team</strong> — one CSV file instead of thirty PDF attachments</li>
                <li><strong>Build a talent database</strong> — keep structured candidate data for future roles</li>
            </ul>
