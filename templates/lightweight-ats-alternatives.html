            <p class="text-gray-500 text-sm mb-10">Reading time: 8 minutes &nbsp;|&nbsp; Topic: Hiring Tools for Small Business</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Enterprise applicant tracking systems are built for companies that hire hundreds of people per year. They're powerful, expensive, and complex — three qualities that make them the wrong choice for most small businesses. But the alternative to a full ATS isn't manual chaos. There are lightweight approaches that give you the organisation and efficiency you need without the overhead you don't.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">This guide explains why enterprise ATS is overkill for small teams and walks through the lightweight alternatives that actually work.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Why Enterprise ATS Is Overkill for Most Small Businesses</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Applicant tracking systems were built for enterprise HR departments managing high-volume, complex hiring across multiple locations, departments, and job categories. They're designed to handle:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li>Hundreds of open roles simultaneously</li>
                <li>Thousands of applications per month</li>
                <li>Teams of recruiters with different access levels</li>
                <li>Complex compliance and documentation requirements</li>
                <li>Integration with payroll, HRIS, and onboarding systems</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Most small businesses have one or two open roles at a time, receive twenty to fifty applications per role, and have one or two people involved in hiring decisions. The full ATS feature set is irrelevant — and the cost is real. Enterprise platforms commonly charge £300–£2,000 per month, billed annually.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">To understand what an ATS actually does and whether you need any of those capabilities, our plain-English explainer on <a href="/what-is-an-ats.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">what an ATS is and what it does</a> breaks it down without jargon.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">What a Small Business Actually Needs From a Hiring Tool</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Strip away the enterprise features and the core requirements for a small business hiring process are simple:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li>Collect applications through one channel</li>
                <li>Screen CVs without reading every word manually</li>
                <li>Track which stage each candidate is at</li>
                <li>Export or share candidate data for team review</li>
                <li>No complex onboarding, no annual contracts</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">This is a much simpler requirements list. And it has much simpler solutions.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Category 1 — Simple Kanban-Based Hiring Trackers</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Tools like Trello, Notion, and ClickUp offer free kanban board templates designed for hiring pipeline management. Each candidate becomes a card that moves through columns: Applied → Screening → Phone Screen → Interview → Offer → Hired.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg"><strong>Best for:</strong> tracking candidate stages and collaborating with team members on hiring decisions.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg"><strong>Gap:</strong> these tools don't parse CVs or screen candidates. You still need to read every application manually before you can move candidates into the pipeline. They solve the tracking problem, not the screening problem.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Category 2 — Lightweight Cloud ATS</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">There's a growing category of SMB-focused ATS products positioned between enterprise systems and manual processes. These typically offer careers page hosting, application collection, basic CV parsing, pipeline management, and team collaboration tools — at lower price points than enterprise alternatives.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg"><strong>Best for:</strong> businesses hiring 10+ people per year who want structured pipeline management built in.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg"><strong>Gap:</strong> even lightweight ATS tools usually require subscription fees and carry the keyword-matching problem — their parsing is typically not semantic, so qualified candidates still get filtered incorrectly. For a comparison of screening approaches, see our analysis of <a href="/free-vs-paid-resume-screening.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">comparing free and paid screening tools</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Category 3 — CV Parsers + Spreadsheets (The Recommended Approach)</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">The most effective lightweight approach for most small businesses combines two simple tools: a semantic CV parser and a spreadsheet.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg"><strong>The workflow:</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li>Receive CVs by email</li>
                <li>Upload to a semantic CV parser (batch upload)</li>
                <li>Parser extracts data and ranks candidates by match to your job description</li>
                <li>Export all candidate data to CSV in one click</li>
                <li>Import into Google Sheets: add columns for stage, interviewer notes, decisions</li>
                <li>Share sheet with anyone involved in the decision</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">This approach gives you the automated screening of an ATS (without the keyword-only limitation), the pipeline tracking of a kanban tool (in a spreadsheet), and the collaboration features you need — all in a stack that costs nothing and requires zero configuration.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">When to Graduate to a Real ATS</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">There are signals that indicate a full ATS investment is justified:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li>You have a dedicated HR person who will own and configure the system</li>
                <li>You're hiring more than 20 people per month consistently</li>
                <li>You have complex compliance requirements that demand documented audit trails</li>
                <li>You're managing multiple open roles with separate hiring teams simultaneously</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Until those thresholds apply, the lightweight stack is the better choice.</p>
