            <p class="text-gray-500 text-sm mb-10">Reading time: 7 minutes &nbsp;|&nbsp; Topic: Resume Screening</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">You post a job, you get applications, and suddenly your inbox contains forty PDFs and Word documents from people you've never met. You have a business to run. The last thing you need is to spend two days reading CVs — and still not feel confident about your shortlist.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">This guide gives you a practical system for screening resumes faster without cutting corners on quality. The goal is a reliable shortlist in a fraction of the usual time.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">The Resume Screening Problem Nobody Talks About</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Research on hiring decisions consistently finds that human CV reviewers spend an average of six to seven seconds on a resume before making an initial pass/fail decision. After reading thirty or forty CVs, decision fatigue sets in: later applications get less careful attention than earlier ones, and bias — toward familiar names, formats, or companies — increases.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">The irony is that more applications often produces worse hires. Higher volume means faster, less considered screening — which is exactly when your best candidate gets missed because their CV was the forty-second one you opened at 6pm on a Friday.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">The solution isn't to read CVs more carefully. It's to change how the screening process is structured.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">What Most Small Business Owners Get Wrong</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li><strong>Reading every word of every CV</strong> — unnecessary until you have a strong shortlist</li>
                <li><strong>No criteria defined upfront</strong> — making decisions based on overall impression rather than specific requirements</li>
                <li><strong>Letting formatting bias decisions</strong> — a beautifully laid-out CV is not the same as a well-qualified candidate</li>
                <li><strong>Doing it all in one sitting</strong> — decision quality falls sharply after the first twenty CVs</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Step 1 — Define Your Must-Haves Before You Open Any CV</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Before you look at a single application, write down three to five non-negotiable criteria. These are the minimum requirements — failing any one of them means the candidate goes no further, regardless of other qualities. Examples:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li>At least 2 years of direct experience in the relevant field</li>
                <li>Based within commutable distance (or open to remote, if applicable)</li>
                <li>Holds a specific required qualification or certification</li>
                <li>Demonstrates experience with a specific tool or technology</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">These criteria become your filter. You're not looking for the best candidate yet — you're eliminating candidates who can't do the job at all. This alone cuts most CV piles by 50–70%.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Step 2 — Use a Two-Pass System</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Once you have your must-haves defined, structure your screening in two passes:</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg"><strong>First pass (30 seconds per CV):</strong> Apply must-have criteria only. Yes or no. Don't get pulled into reading the whole document. You're looking for reasons to exclude, not reasons to include. Move quickly.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg"><strong>Second pass (3–5 minutes per CV):</strong> Only for candidates who passed the first filter. Now you read properly, score against your desirable criteria, and form a view on quality.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">This approach means your careful reading time is spent only on candidates who are already qualified. For a structured approach to the second pass, see our guide on <a href="/how-to-shortlist-candidates.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">how to shortlist candidates effectively</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Step 3 — Let Technology Do the First Pass</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">The two-pass system works even better when the first pass is automated. A semantic CV parser can read all your CVs simultaneously, extract key data from each one, and rank them by match to your job description — all in the time it would take you to open and read three CVs manually.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">The result: you skip straight to the second pass, starting with a pre-ranked shortlist rather than a random pile. When comparing <a href="/ats-vs-manual-screening.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">automated versus manual resume screening</a>, the time savings at this stage typically range from 70–90% of total screening time.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Modern semantic parsers also solve the keyword problem: they understand that "managed a team" and "led a group" describe the same capability, so you don't miss qualified candidates just because they phrased their experience differently. To understand how <a href="/what-is-a-cv-parser.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">CV parsers work</a> in depth, it's worth reading about the technology behind them.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Step 4 — Export and Compare in a Spreadsheet</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Once CVs are parsed, the best tools export all candidate data to CSV. This transforms a pile of PDFs into a sortable, filterable spreadsheet where every candidate occupies one row. You can:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li>Sort by match score to see highest-fit candidates first</li>
                <li>Filter by years of experience to enforce a minimum threshold</li>
                <li>Add a column for your own notes after reviewing each candidate</li>
                <li>Share with a colleague for a second opinion without emailing PDFs around</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Common Mistakes That Slow You Down</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li><strong>Re-reading previously reviewed CVs</strong> — note your decision the first time and don't go back</li>
                <li><strong>No standardised criteria</strong> — if different reviewers use different criteria, you'll disagree and re-do the process</li>
                <li><strong>Sharing printed CVs</strong> — paper piles get lost, can't be searched, and can't be scored consistently</li>
                <li><strong>Screening in bulk without breaks</strong> — screen in sessions of 20 maximum, then take a proper break</li>
            </ul>
