            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">What Makes This Different From Traditional Resume Screening</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Most automated resume screening tools work on a simple principle: scan CVs for the keywords in your job description and filter out anything that doesn't match. The problem is that language doesn't work that way. Candidates describe the same experience in different words.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">A candidate who writes "led a cross-functional team of eight people to deliver a complex software product on time and under budget" has exactly the team management and project delivery experience you're looking for — even if they never used the exact phrase "team management." A keyword filter would reject them. Cv Bam Bam's semantic AI would rank them highly.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">This isn't a marginal improvement. Research suggests that keyword-based systems reject up to 75% of qualified candidates. When you're receiving twenty or thirty applications for a role, that means you might be interviewing from the wrong half of your applicant pool. For a deeper look at the technology, see our guide on <a href="/what-is-a-cv-parser.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">how CV parsing technology works</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">How the AI Screening Works</h2>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Upload Your CV Files</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Batch upload your PDF and Word CV files directly into the tool. No need to upload one at a time — add all your applications at once. The tool handles the rest automatically.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Paste Your Job Description</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">The AI doesn't work from a keyword list — it understands your job description as a natural language description of what you need. Paste your actual job posting. The semantic model interprets requirements, responsibilities, and qualifications holistically.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Get Ranked Results Instantly</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Within seconds, every CV has been parsed, every candidate has been scored against your job description, and the results are ranked from best fit to weakest fit. You see the structured data extracted from each CV alongside the match score — not a pile of documents, but an ordered list of candidates with the information you need to make decisions.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Review and Export</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">Download the full dataset as CSV in one click. Open it in Google Sheets or Excel. Share it with your team. Add columns for interview notes and decisions. Your screening is complete before you've opened a single PDF.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Real Benefits for Small Business Owners</h2>

            <div class="bg-white rounded-xl p-6 shadow-sm border border-gray-100 mb-4">
                <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2"><i class="fas fa-clock text-blue-500 mr-2"></i>Save 10+ Hours Per Hire</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-600">Manual CV reading for thirty applications: 3–5 hours of focused work. With AI screening: under 5 minutes for the same batch. That's time you spend running your business, not reading PDFs.</p>

            <div class="bg-white rounded-xl p-6 shadow-sm border border-gray-100 mb-4">
                <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2"><i class="fas fa-search text-blue-500 mr-2"></i>Find Candidates You'd Otherwise Miss</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-600">Semantic matching finds qualified candidates that keyword-based systems filter out. When your talent pool is limited, every missed candidate is a real cost — potentially the best hire you never considered.</p>

            <div class="bg-white rounded-xl p-6 shadow-sm border border-gray-100 mb-4">

                <p class="text-gray-600">Open the tool, upload your files, paste your description, get results. No account to create, no pipeline to configure, no training session to book. It works immediately.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="bg-white rounded-xl p-6 shadow-sm border border-gray-100 mb-4">
                <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2"><i class="fas fa-file-csv text-blue-500 mr-2"></i>Take Your Data Anywhere</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-600">CSV export means your candidate data lives in your tools — not locked in a third-party platform. Google Sheets, Excel, Notion — wherever you work, your candidate data follows.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">Is AI Resume Screening Right for You?</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">AI screening delivers the most value when:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li>You receive more than 10 CVs per role</li>
                <li>You've ever worried about missing a strong candidate in a large pile</li>
                <li>You're spending hours on screening time that takes you away from other work</li>
                <li>You want consistent decisions across all applications, not fatigue-affected judgment</li>
                <li>You need to share candidate data with someone who isn't going to read every PDF</li>
            </ul>
